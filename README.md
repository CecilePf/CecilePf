🍀 I am 34 years old and I'm a web developer for 3 years. I live next to Metz.

My English is not very good 😊, but I can read and understand technical documentation, write emails... Speaking is more difficult for me ! But I'm motivated and not afraid to learn 🤙

💻 I mainly work with Symfony (4 & 5), HTML/CSS, JS. Again, I am not afraid to learn : I had the opportunity to do internships where I worked with python (Odoo) and Ruby on Rails.

🙌 I’m not an expert, but I like to learn a lot about different subjects !
